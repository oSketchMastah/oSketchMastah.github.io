	<h1> IT and Web Programming </h1>
	</div>
	<p> This page will give a general overview of web programming and provide links to pages that explore certain aspects of web programming 
		in further depth.</p>
<hr>
	<h2> Components of The Web </h1>
	<p> It is often fruitful to study things as a system of interacting parts, that is, it is useful to develop an understanding of a whole thing 
		by developing an understanding of how its parts interact to create that thing as we know it. It is a useful way of understanding most
		concepts, and the internet is no different. </p>
	<p>Roughly, the web is an entity made up of web pages, information, clients, and the various mechanisms by which webpages and information interact with
		the client (users of the web). It is fundamental to understand that all information (including web pages) is sent over a network which we
		call the internet. </p>
	<!-- **************************************** New Section *********************************************** -->
	<h3> The Internet </h2>
	<p> The Internet is a network where the nodes are receivers and transmitters (transponders) of data </p>
	<p> There are a few layers of network constructed for efficiency. Listed in order of proximity to client: </p> 
	<ol> 	<li> The client-place network: network between close proximity clients and single modem </li>
		<li> The place-ISP network: network between modems and Internet Service Provider (ISP) transponders </li>
		<li> The ISP-data network: network between ISP and physical data storage centres/hard drives </li>
	</ol>
	<p> All that need be known for our sake, is that an individual modem interacts with the ISP to request data from somewhere on the internet, 
		the ISP then handles the process of obtaining the data and if successful, completes the users request and returns the data </p>
	<p> Using a command-line interface the client can interact with their computer, other computers connected to their locations network, 
		and even other networks through their ISP or other data transport lines. 
<br>		Some command-line interfaces are 	<a href="../LanguageLibrary/CMD.html"> CMD </a> (Windows),
							<a href="../LanguageLibrary/Bash.html"> BASH </a> (Unix),
						 	<a href="../LanguageLibrary/PowerShell.html"> PowerShell</a>. </p>
	<h3> IP addresses </h2>
	<p> Every machine needs an IP address to communicate with other devices on the internet. There are two types of IP address:</p>
	<ul>	<li> <span class="keywrd"> IPv4 </span>: The version of IP most routers/internet is configured for. Uses 32 bit addressing </li>
		<li> <span class="keywrd"> IPv6 </span>: Uses 128 bit addressing, existing hardware need be upgraded/reconfigured to utilize </li>
	</ul>

	<h4> IPv4 </h3>
	<ul>	<li> uses 4 8-bit (<= 255) numbers represented in base-10 seperated by periods '.' (Ex: <code> 255.100.1.9 </code>) </li> </ul>
	<p> There are 3 addresses reserved for special purposes:  </p>
	<ul>	<li> <span class="keywrd"> 0.0.0.0 </span>: refers to the default network used for routing</li>
		<li> <span class="keywrd"> 255.255.255.255 </span>: The broadcast address: used to broadcast messages to client computers entire network</li>
		<li> <span class="keywrd"> 127.0.0.1 </span>: loopback address, refers to clients machine. All addresses w/ first byte 127 represent loopback addresses</li>
	</ul>
	<p> There are 5 "classes" of IP address, characterized by its first byte and varying in size of allocation: </p>
	<ul>	<li> <span class="keywrd"> Class A (0-126) </span>: partitioned into 126 networks each with 2<sup>24</sup> IP addresses (given to large companies)</li>
		<li> <span class="keywrd"> Class B (128-191)</span>: partitioned into 2<sup>14</sup> networks each with 65,534 IP addresses (given to ISPs/colleges/hospitals)</li>
		<li> <span class="keywrd"> Class C (192-223)</span>: partitioned into 2<sup>21</sup> networks each with 255 IP addresses</li>
		<li> <span class="keywrd"> Class D (224-239)</span>: IP addresses reserved for a service called <span id="keywrd">Multicast</span> </li>
		<li> <span class="keywrd"> Class E (240-255)</span>: IP addresses reserved for experimental use</li>
	</ul>
	<p> There are 3 classes of <span class="keywrd">Private IP addresses </span>, which are not meant to be routed through the internet (and often blocked by ISPs 
		from doing so); used by networks that need to use TCP/IP but do not want to be visible on the internet: </p>
	<ul>	<li> <span class="keywrd"> Class A [10... - 11...) </span></li>
		<li> <span class="keywrd"> Class B [172.16.. - 172.32..)</span></li>
		<li> <span class="keywrd"> Class C [192.168.. - 192.169..)</span></li>
	</ul>
	<p> Devices on private networks <span class="keywrd">should</span> be assigned an IP in one of these ranges, that way only router/firewall has true connection
		to internet, making the network more <span class="keywrd">secure</span> </p>
	<p> Most routers provide a service called <span class="keywrd">DHCP</span> (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) that when given a suitable range of IP values,
		automatically assigns new devices to unnassigned IP addresses. </p>
	<!-- ******************************************** New Section ********************************************** -->
	<h3> TCP/IP, TCP and UDP ports </h3>
	<p> Devices connected to the internet use a protocol called TCP/IP to communicate. Information is sent between IP addresses most commonly using two methods:</p> <ul>
		<li> <span class="keywrd"> TCP </span> (Transmission Control Protocol): Transmitter makes connection with receiver, sends data while maintaining connection till end
			<ul><li> Good in reliability, suffers in efficiency. Packets are numbered upon order, are tracked over network, and receiver sends back confirmation of receipt. </li></ul> </li>
		<li> <span class="keywrd"> UDP </span> (User Datagram Protocol): data transmission into the network, relying on intermediate devices to get information to receiver
			<ul><li> Good in efficiency and speed, suffers in reliability (possibility of failure to receive/ data corruption) </li></ul> </li> 
	</ul>
	<p> <span class="keywrd"> TCP </span> or <span class="keywrd"> UDP </span> may be chosen as the method of data packet transfer based on a variety of factors: </p> <ul>
		<li> <span class="keywrd"> TCP </span> is used when it is absolutely vital that all data be received. </li>
		<li> <span class="keywrd"> UDP </span> is used when it is not essential that all data is received and the latency caused by <span class="keywrd"> TCP </span> would be problematic. (such as in a game/ livestream) </li>
		</ul>
	<p> <span class="keywrd"> Ports </span> are used to accept information by a receiver. Every IP address can have 65,535 TCP and UDP ports. </p>
	<h4> Accessing Online Information </h4>
	<p> Web Pages and Online information are stored on a device with an IP address and <span class="keywrd">ports</span> allowing for access of this information
		from foreign devices over the internet. </p>
	<p> There are default <span class="keywrd">ports</span> assigned to be used for certain protocols: </p> <ul>
		<li> <span class="keywrd"> TCP port 80 </span>: used by HTTP by default</li>
		<li> <span class="keywrd"> TCP port 20 and 21 </span>: used by FTP by default </li>
	</ul>
