	<h1> Laws of Thought </h1>
	</div>
	<p> The goal here is to distill a sense of the nature of mathematical reasoning through a direct analysis of the reasoning process. Through this analysis,
		much will be covered. You can expect to know the following by the end: </p> <ul>
			<li> Construction of Truth-value Statements and their Semiotics</li>
			<li> Understanding usage of relationship between Semantics and Syntax for proof and construction (<i>explored further in other chapters</i>)</li>
			<li> Many principles for the pursuit of further knowledge </li>
	</ul>
<hr><hr>
	<p> I find it is helpful to follow the path of knowledge taken by our ancestors in our own intellectual persuits, so I'll start off with the "Laws of Thought"
			that have been established since the times of Aristotle. There were three laws that were taken as presumptions, or things that must hold, in the structure
			of any valid argument. These 3 laws were as follows: </p><ul>
			<li><span class="keywrd">Law of Non-Contradiction</span>: This law states that no valid argument can imply a contradiction, a contradiction occurs 
				when a statement is implied to be both true and false. Put simply, it cannot be necessary for any statement to be both true and false based on ones <b>axioms</b></li>
			<li><span class="keywrd">Law of the Excluded Middle</span>: This law states that any statement must be either true or false, there is no in-between. However, this was a law
				derived by observing straight-forward arguments, and since then we have found this isn't always true, as a statement may be indeterminate given what we know. However this can generally be proven or disproven 
				in any particular case, and given determinacy, it seems this law then always holds and can thus be used in the deductive process. </li>
			<li><span class="keywrd">Law of Identity</span>: This law states that any thing or property must be identical to itself, in other words, any valid argument should not suggest
				that something is not something else which is not perceptually identical to itself in the context that it is uttered.</li>
	</ul> 
	<p>There are some understandings of the terms I have used in my description of these laws that will come in handy:<br>
		Ones <span class="keywrd">Axioms</span> are all of the statements that are assumed, deemed, or imposed to be true for the purpose of deducing further information.
		Mathematicians take axioms very seriously, and for good reason. The best <span class="keywrd">Arguments</span> are in the form of an implication or series
		of implications. For example, if someone asks, "Why is <b>A</b> (some mathematical object) the same as <b>C</b> (other mathematical object)":</p>
		<p class="indent"> the worst response - no reasoning given: "Because, <b>A</b> is the same as <b>C</b>"</p>
		<p class="indent"> a (variably) better response: "Because, <b>A</b> is the same as <b>B</b>, and <b>B</b> is the same as <b>C</b>, which means that <b>A</b> is also the same as <b>C</b>" <ul>
			<li>  	This form of explanation works best when ones axioms make it clear why <b>A</b> is identical or <i>'same'</i> to <b>B</b>, and why it to <b>C</b>. It also assumes the understanding
				that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_relation">equivalence</a> is a transitive relation. </li> </ul> 
		</p>
		<p> This applies to <b>understanding</b> the same way it applies to arguing or explaining. If you start off by understanding and refining your <i>axioms</i>, and can be sure of their
			applicability and truth, you can use these with an understanding of <i>logic</i> to derive facts that are (must be) true based on the truth of your axioms. You can then use
			logic with these newly derived truths to deduce further truth. By practicing this, you will enhance your sense of <span class="keywrd">causal structure</span>, and be better
			able to critically and objectively analyze the world around you.</p>
	<p>It is good, initially, to understand logic as a collection of information that serves as a tool for rationally deriving factual statements based on groups
		of other statements that are believed to be factual. In boolean logic, the description of a statements truth (called its <span class="keywrd">truth-value</span>),
		can take on one of two values, <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>. The two-valued description of truth-value that is used in boolean logic is useful when dealing
		with statements that are well-defined, as to not introduce the concept of 'partial truth'. A statement may have a 'degree of truth', which is described as
		a value between 0 (undeniably false) and 1 (undeniably true), such statements arise when people use terms that introduce ambiguity, or even when one wishes to
		directly deal with, or analyze the effects of variabilities in ignorance and interpretation within a system. The logic using such 
		partial truth is called <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzy_logic">fuzzy logic</a></i>.<br>
	fuzzy logic is a relatively new thing to math, having only been conceived in the 20th century. The vast majority of mathematical truth
		was discovered using boolean logic, making it a reasonable thing for us to consider learning first.</p>
	<h2>Statements</h2>
	<p>Statements in general make a 'claim' about some 'object'. The claim says something about the state of this object, whether it be 
			an absolute description of the state, or one described in relation to another object. Statements also have a truth-value, the overall statement
			can either be true or false, and it is the conduct of logic to determine what or if statements are true or false, as well as in what contexts the 
			relevant statements truth-value holds.</p>
	<p>Logic is tricky, there is no singular mechanism by which any and all statements get their truth value. One good distinction is
		that between imposed and derivably true statements. We can impose truths by defining what things mean, for example, "bird" means
		bird (the warm-blooded, egg-laying, vertebrates with feathers, wings, and a beak) because we say it does, it has its meaning because we agreed on it, 
		and wrote it in a dictionary. In this sense, a bird is a bird because we say it's a bird. On the other hand, there's also derived truth like "some birds can fly", which could
		be <i>seen</i> and taken as stand-alone fact, or other-wise shown to be true as a result of the wing structure of some birds combined with physical law enabling the action flight. </p>
	</p>
	<p>
		The bird example <i>might</i> seem irrelevent to mathematical logic, but I assure you that logic works the same regardless of where it is used.
		The same way we can define what it means to be a bird, we could also define what it means to be some sort of mathematical object. The same way we determine 
		that a feature or property of many birds is flight, we could determine features and properties of a mathematical object. <br>	
		Of course, I have been simplifying things up until now. The nature of how we impose truth is not always to define what it means to be something. <i>Definition</i>
		is only a part of it. We can also <i>Interpret</i> one thing as another, which is what we do when we use symbols to semantically represent some value or property, although
		this is made possible because we can define how symbols interact with one another however we want. Another <i>type</i> of interpretation can happen when two objects of 
		a different form have the same properties, which allows us to use the two forms in talking about one object interchangeably, the most famous example of this would be 
		linear operations and transformation matrices.
	</p>
	<h2>Logical Operators</h2>
	<hr> <!--CopyPasta from here on out-->
	<h3> Semiotics and Structure between Statements </h3>
	<p> In Mathematics, the use of symbols instead of words to communicate often complex statements is just one behavior adopted as a means of increasing productivity.
		Roughly speaking, if you replace an 8 letter word with a single symbol (meaning the symbol carries the same meaning as the word), you've reduced the 
		time it takes to communicate the same idea by a factor of 8. When you realize that you only need a few unique words to describe what's going on in a situation, 
		and you replace each of those words with a well-chosen symbol, the ease with which one can communicate their ideas on the situation improves drastically.</p>
	<p> Pure Logic is no different. We allocate meaning to symbols and from that point on express our ideas in those symbols where applicable. When I communicate ideas
		about relationships between arbitrary statements, I'll give each unique statement its own unique symbol, and instead of trying to refer to the hypothetical 
		statement by word, I'd refer to it using the symbol that I have made its alias. We'll also see that many statements are made by composing other statements,
		and these various compositions will also be referenced using a symbol, instead of a word descriptor. </p>
	<p><span id="keywrd"> ** Hypothetical/ arbitrary statements are conventionally aliased using symbols such as 
		<span style="font-family: symbol">j</span> or <span style="font-family: symbol">f</span></span></p>
	<p><span id="keywrd"> Structure </span> between statements comes in the form of how we can compose them to make new statements, and the relationships we
		can figure out between the truth-values of statements that possess different forms. </p>
	<p> There are several compositional notions: conjunction, disjunction, implication, equivalence, and many others. You even get some structure when you consider 
		that for every statement, there is a statement that says the exact opposite of what the first one says (if the first one claims truth, the second claims falsehood).
		These are collectively called logical operators, because you can think of them as "operating" on some statements to produce a new statement with a new truth-value.
		The logical operators are best defined by a truth-table which shows how the operator maps truth-values of the composed statements to the truth-value of the
		resulting statement. However, there is an intuitive way of thinking about its operation that I include with this table. </p>
	<p><span style="font-family: Engravers MT"> Def<sup>N</sup> </span>: <span id="keywrd"> Negation (\(\neg\))</span>: Yields statement claiming falsehood (antithesis) of other statement, replaces the word "not".</p>
	<span> In other words, if \( R = \neg \phi \), the truth-table definition would be: </span>
	<table> <tr> <th> \(\phi\) </th> <th> \(R\) </th> </tr>
		<tr> <td> True </td> <td> False </td> </tr>
		<tr> <td> False </td> <td> True </td> </tr>
	</table>
	<p><span style="font-family: Engravers MT"> Def<sup>N</sup> </span>: <span id="keywrd"> Conjunction (\(\wedge\))</span>: Yields statement claiming truth of each of two statements, replaces the word "and".</p>
	<span> In other words, if \( R = \phi \wedge \psi \), the truth-table definition would be: </span>
	<table> <tr> <th> \(\phi\) </th> <th> \(\psi\) </th> <th> \(R\) </th> </tr>
		<tr> <td> True </td> <td> True </td> <td> True </td> </tr>
		<tr> <td> True </td> <td> False </td> <td> False </td> </tr>
		<tr> <td> False </td> <td> True </td> <td> False </td> </tr>
		<tr> <td> False </td> <td> False </td> <td> False </td> </tr>
	</table>
	<p><span style="font-family: Engravers MT"> Def<sup>N</sup> </span>: <span id="keywrd"> Disjunction (\(\vee\))</span>: Yields statement claiming truth of atleast one of two statements, replaces the word "or".</p>
	<span> In other words, if \( R = \phi \vee \psi \), the truth-table definition would be: </span>
	<table> <tr> <th> \(\phi\) </th> <th> \(\psi\) </th> <th> \(R\) </th> </tr>
		<tr> <td> True </td> <td> True </td> <td> True </td> </tr>
		<tr> <td> True </td> <td> False </td> <td> True </td> </tr>
		<tr> <td> False </td> <td> True </td> <td> True </td> </tr>
		<tr> <td> False </td> <td> False </td> <td> False </td> </tr>
	</table>
	<p><span style="font-family: Engravers MT"> Def<sup>N</sup> </span>: <span id="keywrd"> Implication (\(\implies\))</span>: Yields statement claiming that truth of first statement implies truth of second, replaces the word "implies".</p>
	<span> In other words, if \( R = (\phi \implies \psi) \), the truth-table definition would be: </span>
	<table> <tr> <th> \(\phi\) </th> <th> \(\psi\) </th> <th> \(R\) </th> </tr>
		<tr> <td> True </td> <td> True </td> <td> True </td> </tr>
		<tr> <td> True </td> <td> False </td> <td> False </td> </tr>
		<tr> <td> False </td> <td> True </td> <td> True </td> </tr>
		<tr> <td> False </td> <td> False </td> <td> True </td> </tr>
	</table> <p> It is important to understand why we define the truth-table for implication this way. First of all, all results must either be true or false, so we have to choose. Next, We must realize that in determining 
		if the truth of \(\phi\) implies the truth of \(\psi\), we are showing that when \(\phi\) is true, that \(\psi\) is then also true. We don't care about when \(\phi\) is false, because then \(\psi\) could be anything
		and its truth-value status would not affect the truth-value of the overall statement. The rule is that such a statement is <span id="keywrd">false if and only if \(\phi\) is true but \(\psi\) is nevertheless false. </span></p>
	
	<p><span style="font-family: Engravers MT"> Def<sup>N</sup> </span>: <span id="keywrd"> Material Equivalence (\(\iff\))</span>: Yields statement claiming two statements to have the same truth-value, replaces phrases "if and only if"</p>
	<span> In other words, if \( R = (\phi \iff \psi) \), the truth-table definition would be: </span>
	<table> <tr> <th> \(\phi\) </th> <th> \(\psi\) </th> <th> \(R\) </th> </tr>
		<tr> <td> True </td> <td> True </td> <td> True </td> </tr>
		<tr> <td> True </td> <td> False </td> <td> False </td> </tr>
		<tr> <td> False </td> <td> True </td> <td> False </td> </tr>
		<tr> <td> False </td> <td> False </td> <td> True </td> </tr>
	</table>
	<p> These are all the logical operators that I care to define, although there are others that some care to use such as exclusive disjunction (aliased using \(\oplus\)) or reverse implication (a backwards \(\implies\)). These aren't as fundamental,
		and in fact, any statement involving any other logical operators can be rewritten (be shown equivalent) to a statement using just negations, conjunctions, and disjunctions. It's worth defining the ones I have because equivalence and implication
		constitute a rather significant part of our discourse in this chapter, and mathematics as a whole, and thus I care to address them directly. </p>
	<p> Before I move on entirely, it's worth mentioning how to <span id="keywrd">translate</span> statements uttered by humans into these semiotically prescribed 
		"forms" shown above.
<br>		Use the statements semantics, which is constant between the semiotic and human spoken versions of the statement. For example, semantically, perhaps you can tell that some uttered statement was an implication,
		then, you can semantically seperate it into a hypothesis (something which is assumed to be true), and a consequence (proposed to be true as a consequence of the hypothesis). If you can do that, you've
		already put the spoken version of the implication into the same form of implication as defined above (hypothesis \(\implies\) consequence). This technique of <span id="keywrd">semantic partitioning</span> is often a handy trick.</p>
<!-- **************************************************************************************************************************************** -->
	<h3> Logical Equivalences (\(\equiv\))</h3>
	<p> I'll start off by saying that logical equivalence is a whole lot more powerful to establish than material equivalence. In mathematics, the two types of equivalences come pretty well as a package, and 
		so it is not uncommon that students go through it without ever making the distinction. A <span id="keywrd">material equivalence</span> is a logical operator that claims truth-value equality. Whereas 
		<span id="keywrd">logical equivalence</span> asserts truth-value equality by claiming semantic equivalence (true by pure logic and meaning). Logical equivalence is established by 
		showing that two <span id="keywrd">forms</span> of statement have the same truth-value regardless of any content in the statement. </p>
	<p> There are many really great, meaningful logical equivalences that you should incorporate into how you reason about everyday dilemmas. These are often
		directly the small change in perspective that makes the truth of a fact significantly more obvious. In fact, it's not uncommon that material equivalence
		is defined using the logical equivalence:</p>
	<p> \[ (\phi \iff \psi) \equiv (\phi \implies \psi) \wedge (\psi \implies \phi)\] 
	This definition is chosen because it's a great definition, not only can we show it equivalent to the truth-table definition, 
	but it shows you can prove material equivalence of two statements by simply proving that both statements are implied by eachother, which is often much easier. 
<br>	</p>
