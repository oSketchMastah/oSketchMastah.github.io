<div class="main_title"><h1>Need Computer Help?</h1></div>
<p>Live in Brockville and need any kind of computer help? <b>I offer the guarantee of being the most affordable option in the Brockville area. If you can show me a business that does it cheaper, I'll update my pricing</b>. I also make the guarantee that I test the computers I repair for proper function in all aspects, so unlike some Brockville businesses offering similar services, you can rest easy knowing it'll be done right the first time. </p>
<p><b>Standard Diagnostic Fee: $20</b> <br>
  For less than any business in the area, I'll figure out what's wrong with your computer, and if the fix is particularly easy (as is the case for lots of malware) I'll fix it at no additional cost! If the fix is more work than I'm willing to do for free, I'll text or call you with the details of what I found and the price I'm asking for fixing it.
</p>

<p>Here's a list of some of the things I can do for you: <ul>
<hr>
  <li> Figuring out why a computer is being slow and (hopefully) fixing the problem.<ul>
     <li>I can get rid of most malware really easily, in the worst case scenario I can factory reset things for you.</li>
     <li>I can fix some common physical problems, figure out what's broken and advise you on replacing it, or replace broken parts myself when I have spares.</li> </ul>
  </li>
<hr>
  <li> Swapping around parts to make the best computer possible. <ul>
     <li> You could provide me with parts and a specification for what you want, OR</li>
     <li> You could give me a bunch of old computers and ask me to swap parts between them to make the best thing possible.</li></ul>
  </li>
<hr>
  <li> Salvaging from a dead computer <ul>
    <li>Data recovery from the drive</li>
    <li>Getting any removable parts from the computer (RAM cards, HDD/SSD, battery, network chip, etc)</li>
  </ul></li>
<hr>
  <li> Getting a specification for how to operate parts (ex. in an embedded environment) VIA locating data sheets or using a combination of domain knowledge and testing. I offer my knowledge on things for free, and will take care of figuring out the details of a part for a price. </li>
<hr>
  <li> Installing or upgrading operating system. </li>
</ul>
