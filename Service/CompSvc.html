<div class="main_title"><h1>Need Computer Help?</h1></div>
<p>Live in Brockville and need any kind of computer help? We offer affordable and general services.</p>
<p><b>Standard Diagnostic Fee: $20</b> <br>
  I'll figure out what's wrong with your computer, and if the fix is particularly easy (as is the case for lots of malware) I'll fix it at no additional cost! If it's more complicated I'll text or call with the details of what I found and the what kind of price I'd fix it for. Reach me by texting or calling 226-751-5064, or emailing sketch@mainintelligence.org.
</p>
<p>Here's a list of some of the things I can do for you: <ul>
<hr>
  <li>Figuring out why a computer is being slow and (hopefully) fixing the problem.<ul>
     <li>I can get rid of most malware really easily, in the worst case scenario I can reset things for you.</li>
     <li>I can find and fix hardware problems, advise you on what can be done, or order parts and do upgrades or repairs myself.</li> </ul>
  </li>
<hr>
  <li>Salvaging from a dead computer <ul>
    <li>Data recovery from the drive</li>
    <li>Getting any usable parts from the computer (RAM cards, HDD/SSD, battery, network chip, etc)</li>
  </ul></li>
<hr>
  <li>Swapping around parts to make the best computer possible. <ul>
     <li> You could provide me with parts and a specification for what you want, OR</li>
     <li> You could give me a bunch of old computers and ask me to swap parts between them to make the best thing possible.</li></ul>
  </li>
<hr>
  <li>Installing or upgrading operating system.</li>
<hr>
  <li>Maybe other things? Whatever it is feel free to ask, there are tons of things I would totally help with that I'm not going to list off here. Think of us anytime you need a professional nerd! </li>
</ul>
