	<h1>MI Services</h1>
	</div>
	
	<p> Welcome to the MI services page. </p>
	<p> Here, you can access all the web services provided by MI that can't be shown on a 
	static web page!</p>
	<p> Note: I currently provide all services from my laptop (I know I'm bad, calm down)
		and as long as that's true I won't guarantee 100% uptime.
		However, I rarely shut down entirely for the night (and will try hard not to when
		there are users), and only occasionally restart the system to keep it fresh..
		so there is some reliability.
	</p>
	<p> <b><i> In short, </i></b> If it wasn't obvious, I recommend not using these services in any
		commercial products, not that I mind (your customers might!). If you want to have some
		guarantee of uptime, I'm open to inquiries about helping with hosting. </p>
	<div  class="Box" style="margin:10px">
	<p> Send us thoughts, feedback or inquiries! (and maybe get a response)</p>
	<form name="publish">
  	<textarea style="width: 90vw; height: 10vh" name="message"> </textarea>
 	<input type="submit" value="Send"> </input>
	</form>
	<p> Talk: <div id="messages"> </div> </p>
	</div>
	<p>Please note that if you leave the page after sending feedback I won't be able to respond
		until you submit new feedback. (doing so sends an asynchronous request that maintains connection
		until one of a few conditions occur, one of the conditions being that I respond)</p>
	<!--Need to store all sorts of state on server,
	unless we program it to send fresh data to the github hosted version-->
	<div class="Box">
	<p> Forums - TODO </p>
	</div>
	<p> The problem with forums is that it requires a lot of state to be done well.
	For instance, I'd have to add an authentication system so people can build a profile,
	and not have it compromised through any means, I'd have to do something to protect against
	spam and bad requests from bots (as someone who doesn't monitor internet traffic, I think
	you'd be surprised how bad the bot traffic and port scanner situation really is). Along-side
	all of that, I'd be committing to storing various threads packed full of information.
	so maybe I ought to hold off on forums until I set up a cloud provider or more disk space \_(o_o)_/.
	</p>
	<!--need download for multichat, our server just handles
	providing a web UI for accessing multicast streams-->
	
	<p> MultiChat (in development) - allows communication with only a little state information.
	We simply provide gateways to chat rooms, where you begin seeing typed/streamed information only
	from the point at which you join the chat. (We only store information about which rooms
	have been registered for use, and perhaps eventually the number of people/hostname and such)</p>

	<p> MultiChat - Download Latest </p>
	<button class="Box" style="background-color: white">

	<p> MultiChat is a console application that interfaces with MI services to register
	 a multicast stream with ease, as well as find and join other multicast data streams that are 
	 registered in a public fashion.
