		<h1> Mathematics Knowledge Interface </h1>
	</div>
	<p> Welcome, this interface is designed to guide you to the mathematics knowledge you desire, The <span class="keywrd">"Navigate"</span> tab (at the top of the screen) will drop down a list of
		links, each leading to different groups of knowledge. Here, I will describe our Philosophy in teaching mathematics in both the wider context
		as well as the layout of the mathematics portion of this website. <br>
		There's a fair bit of planning that went into the structure of the site from this point on, so the theme of your desired knowledge should
		make it easy to decide the path to take using the <span class="keywrd">"Navigate"</span> tab at the top of the screen. The following illustration shows the topics you'll
		find as links to the respective links of this website: </p>
	<p>	<span class="keywrd">Logic and Proof </span>: This portion is devoted to providing a foundation for clear thinking by providing you with just the knowledge that mathematicians use
			in their own practice of clear thinking. Collectively, you could think of what is taught here as being guidelines for rigorous thought, analysis, argument, and proof. <ul>
			<li> <span class="keywrd">Laws of Thought</span>: A conspectus of what must <span class="keywrd">always</span> be true in any conceivable universe... and our thoughts; Logic, the language of reason </li> 
			<li> <span class="keywrd">Representation, Definition, and Interpretation</span>: A look at all the wonderful ways information can describe, and be described. </li>
				<!-- Include Chapter on Meaning and Form here -->
			<li> <span class="keywrd">Heuristics and Memory</span>: A look at how we can hack our brains to do the unbelievable; memory recall methods and function </li></ul>
	</p>
	<p>	<span class="keywrd">Algebras - Objects, Numbers, and Systems</span>: This portion will teach you how algebra can be used to better understand mathematical systems by showing how
			algebra can be used to develop those mathematical systems from the ground up.<ul>
			<li> <span class="keywrd">To be Whole - It's Natural</span>: A look at how the concepts of addition and semantic aliasing can lead to algebra and the entire infinitum of <span class="keywrd">whole</span> numbers. </li> 
			<li> <span class="keywrd">Let's Get Real, then Surreal - Embracing the Continuum</span>: A look at how whole numbers can be extended into a continuum, and how it can be studied. </li>
				<!-- Include Chapter on Meaning and Form here -->
			<li> <span class="keywrd">Adding Complexity - Complex Numbers and Function</span>: A look at complex numbers and their use in science and pure math/ calculus. </li>
			<li> <span class="keywrd">Higher Dimensions - Linear Algebra from Scratch</span>: A look at how larger structures can be described with 'larger' numbers; A Breakdown of Linear Algebra.</li>
			<li> <span class="keywrd">The Graph Structure - Topology and Abstraction</span>: A look at how to think mathematically about any system of related things. </li></ul>
	</p>
	<p> <span class="keywrd">Calculus - Continuum Mechanics</span>: This portion will teach you how to reason about objects existing on a continuum, primarily through employing ideas built up
		in the previous two major sections. <ul> 
		<li> <span class="keywrd">Definitions: Limits, Derivatives, Integrals and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus</span>: A thorough look at the definitions of the tools used in Calculus, and understanding
			the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (FTC).  **Try and read this first and relate the definitions you learn here to the skills you learn in the later sections</li>
		<li> <span class="keywrd">Derivatives - A Guide to Measuring Change</span>: A thorough look at how some added structure used to describe infinitessimal change allows us to measure rates of change whilst
				developing the technique of syntactic parsing. </li>
		<li> <span class="keywrd">Integrals - The Art of Continuous Sums</span>: A thorough look at how one can express and evaluate summations over arbitrary regions in arbitrary numbers of dimension;
				practice in the art of creation. </li>
	</ul>
	</p>
