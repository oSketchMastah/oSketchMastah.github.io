<h1>Dependence</h1>
</div>
<p> This section will go over the dependencies of MI modules. </p>
	<p> This is a good place to look if you need to know the details of which repositories to search for code that is used in one of our repos.
		Specifically, you might be here if you're looking to limit your search in what repository owns an interface that is provided in an MI
		header file.
	</p>
	<p> It should be noted: </p>
	<ul> I don't care much for having unneccessary dependence. Most refined MI code does not rely on std namespace types, nor anything that isn't provided by MI.
		You should be able to find all of the interfaces provided in headers of our publicly available code within other publicly available MI repositories at 
		<a href="https://github.com/MainIntelligence"> github.com/MainIntelligence </a> </ul>
	
	<p> It is useful to make the distinction between stand-alone modules and modules that depend on others. </p>
	<h2> Stand-alone modules </h2>
	<p> These serve primarily as groups of utilities for other code (including other MI code) to use in abstracting
		away a bit of the low-level complexity inherit in programming in C, C++. The goal of these is typically
		to provide something that is both generic (very applicable) and minimal (not overly optomised in a way that
		puts any bias on usage) Typically there is good thought put into what satisfies being 'minimal' according to the purpose
		of the component at hand, you can generally count on this meaning that nothing is provided that is outside of the scope
		of functionality of the component. (ie. typically no under-the-hood safety checks on correct usage, although there is
		typically methods provided to simplify the process of doing so when you deem it necessary) </p>
	<ul>
		<li> PolicyLib </li>
			<p> This is a place for code that provides a group of functionality, typically as a base class through the use of inheritance (CRTP in particular). 
				this is used to register a bunch of semantics and usage for a type, generally requiring some conditions be met on said type. (called the policy)
				By nature, this will always be stand-alone template code delivering very generic functionality with great ease. </p>
		<li> Memorable </li>
			<p> A bunch of memory-related functionality is provided here. Many of the types here are also geared towards handling interactions
				with file storage. (for example, our package system, which allows for information to persist between sessions of a program, 
				and to be maintained within sessions without much change involved in how you actually go about manipulating your data in C++.)</p>
	</ul>
