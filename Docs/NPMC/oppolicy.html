<h1>Operator Policy (FullComparor)</h1>
</div>
<p> In PolicyLib, the class at MIFullComparor.h defines !=, <=, and >= operators for a derived type, under the policy that the derived type implement the opposite (negative) operator for each one of the 3 desired operators (!=, <=, or >=). </p>
<p> To simplify your understanding of which operators you need to define, I say "You define a <b>strong</b> 		comparison, then you get the "opposite" and weak comparison.". It is strong in the sense of a strong premise, something that is more limited, or requires more restrictions to be true. (The strong comparisons are ==, <, and >), </p>
<p> Notice how for a set of items where all of these comparisons make sense, 
all of the strong comparisons are true for less items than for the "weak" comparisons. (ex. == is only true between an element and itself, whereas != is true between an element and any element in the universe of elements for which it is not the same.) </p>
<p>Notice also how for every element in a universe, if you took another element, semantically exactly one of the two comparisons ..
			(a strong comparison like ==, and its weak counterpart !=) must be true, while the other is false. 
			(to be same is to be not different, and to be different is to be not same) </p>
<p> Put differently, the union of all items in the universe for which exactly one of the two comparisons is true is indeed, the universe of elements to which the items belong. </p>
<p>
		with the strong comparison <, the corresponding weak comparison is >= (one is true, the other is false, between any pair. + there are typically less elements in a set for which < (less than) is true compared to its opposite (>=), which is true between any pair for which "<" compares false.</p>
<p> With the semantics explained above, it should be clear that > is a strong comparison, and <= it's weak comparison counterpart (defined automatically by MI::FullComparor) </p>
</p>
