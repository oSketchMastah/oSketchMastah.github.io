<h1>Complex Numbers</h1>
</div>
<p> I wrote up a template structure for complex numbers the other day in order to solve a real problem.
	Since I think I'll be using it for other practical things, and because it seems like good mathematical cleverness,
	I'll talk about the practical usage of complex numbers in code here. If you don't understand what I mean
	by real axis, or imaginary axis, then I recommend learning the basics from the first bit of the wikipedia article:
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number </a>
	
</p>
	
<p>
	To make a long story short, complex numbers are incredibly optimal for describing rotations.
	When I say they are optimal, I'm talking both speed and memory. For two dimensional rotations,
	a matrix takes 4 items (used to represent entries in matrix) to rotate a vector, whereas a
	complex number can be used to rotate that same vector with only 2 items (called the real and imaginary parts). 
	The number of operations to rotate a point in the two-dimensions is about the same, however just about
	everything else is done more efficiently using complex numbers (consider that less data needs to get moved around).
	You can use complex numbers in two (semantically) different ways: <ol>
		<li> A position in 2D space. - Treat it like a position, behaves like vector under addition and subtraction.</li>
		<li> An object serving as a representation of an action on an arbitrary point. - generally used to describe
			 rotational action, but can also be used to represent arbitrary transformations. </li>
	</ol>
	<p> Basically, if you take a complex number, then it will have: <ol>
		<li>An angle - the angle needed to rotate from somewhere on the real axis, to somewhere along the position vector
			 representation of the complex number.</li>
		<li>A magnitude - the length you need to travel from origin (0,0) to get the end of the position vector. </li>
	</ol>
	</p>
	<p> I already mentioned that addition and subtraction behave just like they would for position vectors.
		Multiplication and division are a different story.
		It is quite easy to work out why the following properties are true given the <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/FieldAxioms.html"> field axioms</a>. </p>
	<hr>
	<p> The angle of the complex number (as defined above), is also how much it would rotate another complex number
		through multiplication.
	    The magnitude in this case, is also the factor by which it will "extend" (outward from origin) the other complex number.
	</p>
	<hr>
	When the magnitude of a complex number is exactly 1, it acts purely as a rotator, which over many multiplications
		will move a point around in a circular fashion (while keeping the rotated point at the same distance from (0,0).),
		rotating by a constant angle for every multiplication (which is also true 
		given any <b><i>constant</i></b> complex number, not just those of length 1).
	<p>
	I almost forgot to mention division!
	division by a complex number is the same as multiplication by its multiplicative inverse (field axioms).
	the multiplicative inverse of a complex number has a magnitude that is the reciprocal of the original complex numbers
	magnitude. (which is obvious because their magnitude needs to reduce to 1 through multiplication)
	<b><i>More importantly</i></b>, the angle of the inverse will be one of the same <b>size</b> but in the opposite direction.
		(ie. going clockwise instead of counter-clockwise). Again, this should seem obvious under the field axioms,
		and the semantics of complex multiplication, the only way of 'undoing' (inverting) multiplication 
		by a complex number (rotating by some angle in a direction), is to rotate back to where you started.
		Of course, you can still choose to think of this as rotating backwards by some angle, or rotating so
		far forewards that you get back to where you wanted to go, the math works out the same.
