<h1>Notes on Mathematical Cleverness</h1>
</div>
<p> I wasn't always a programmer. My first real intellectual pursuit was teaching myself calculus as a kid. I had been taught the basic idea of functions and algebra,
	and had come to understand it all as a type of deductive system that holds given certain properties for the underlying objects with respect to the ways they
	can interact with one another. (this is a somewhat generic description for an algebra, it is worth being generic in the long term.).
	With calculus, I came to understand it as a totally new, and yet somewhat similar deductive system, similar to basic algebra. (even some properties, like the basic
		interactions/operations involved are the same, such as linearity). I came to understand how all "mathematical definitions", are just a very precise, semiotically
		expressed version of a more intutive meaning. Sometimes you have to squint, but eventually it becomes obvious that derivatives (by definition) measure "rates of change",
		or that the delta-epsilon definition of a limit just measures the idea of mutual approach to a point.
	In short, there are always definitions, which could potentially express a simple idea in a somewhat complicated way (It's chosen for utility! not comprehension)
	Then there's stuff that follows from those definitions. This is where most of the magic gets made, where the utility of our definitions get put to use. </p>

<p> Enough digression. The point of it is, sometimes I'll define something in a very mathematical way, and in interest of awareness, I'll use this section
	of the docs to walk through the mathematical usage of a type when it seems necessary. </p>
