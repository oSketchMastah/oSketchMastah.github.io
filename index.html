	<h1> Global Knowledge Portal </h1>
	</div>
	<p> Welcome to the ProjectFreeKnowledge! The free knowledge project. </p>
	<p> This website is designed to lead you to whatever knowledge you desire! Scroll over the "Navigate" tab on the navigation bar to see a drop-down list
		of links leading to more knowledge-specific web pages. Use other tabs on the navigation bar to quickly reach specific domains of knowledge. </p>
	<h2> Manifesto: </h2>
	<p> In my life, and in the lives of many, we've been victims of a scourge. Knowledge and its access points have, and are, being monopolized. 
		Access to quality learning resources costs serious money, something which low-income students simply cannot afford, and which is bound even to
		deter middle-class students from learning what interests them. We need to realize that resolving this monopoly is paramount to the 
		development of societies globally. There are some premises that can be carefully observed in today's world: <ol>
			<li> The free education provided by the state in first-world countries is often subpar, which is done shamelessly during an important 
				period of intellectual development in the youth </li>
			<li> By economic law, those with quality knowledge are not willing, or able to form a comprehensive outlook on their area of expertise 
				for the public without asking for an often significant amount of money </li>
			<li> People are people, and it is typical to listen to whoever you believe society thinks you should listen to, while being negligent in 
				using critical thinking as a guide in finding other sources of information that satisfy current needs, or even facilitate a path 
				to long-term learning. Since parents are people who often let themselves fall into this same mode, they are also unlikely to know where 
				to send their children to best satisfy their intellectual curiosities, which gives positive feedback to this societal tendency.</li> </ol>
		The importance of these premises is unspeakable. The average person in any first-world country is not able to afford private school, so they go to
		public school. The standards for public school teachers is low, and most have not achieved anything near the level of <b>wisdom</b> that is often
		demonstrated by the typical university professor. In my times as an IB (International Baccalaureate) student attending a public high school, it was
		so common for my teacher to simply read from the textbook, that I let my attendance slip simply because I could do that myself, in the comfort of my own home.
		The reasons for my disinterest were simple, there was no personal wisdom being conveyed when reading a textbook verbatim. Wisdom in approaching a domain
		of knowledge was what I sought, the kind of wisdom that allows you to pick up knowledge and retain it due to the virtue of understanding why the facts
		are true so well that knowing and concluding it to be true, as well as using the fact of its truth in other endeavors becomes a trivial task. Here, we try to
		teach as much of the relevant wisdom as we can early on, as to avoid as much of the confusion as possible when dealing with the concepts that come up later on.
		If you think this website, or other freely accessible education websites do an effective job at giving you useful knowledge, I plead you to share it with a friend
		that you think might be interested, and encourage them to encourage others. All the information is out there, but not enough people know where to find it, 
		it costs you nothing to offer them a new free channel for learning, and in the long-run that simple referral could have given them knowledge that proves life-changing.
		The demand, especially for jobs that require a knowledge of Math and Computer Science related skill-sets, when compared to the supply of qualified people is significant.
		By taking the time to learn you protect yourself from recession as IT and jobs requiring higher degrees of intellectual creativity become more and more common, and 
		by encouraging the learning of others you help set them on a path to clarity, and by setting enough people on this path to clarity, and encouraging them to set others on 
		the same path, I like to think you do the world a tremendous favour. </p>
