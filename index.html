<p> Hello frens! If you don't like some aspect of the website colors, feel free to customize it with this tool: <a href="Color/colorpage.html">Color Picker 9000</a>

<p> MainIntelligence does lots of stuff! There are a few different reasons you might be looking here:
  <div class="Box"><b>Looking to read about something technical and interesting?</b><hr> I think and research a lot, and I try to distill the wisdom I get into something that people can understand. Maybe I'll setup a forum and a system that lets people contribute to the project that gets developed alongside the technical discussions. In general someplace you can nerd out shamelessly.</div>
  <div class="Box"><b>Looking for someone to help with computer problems?</b><hr> I can diagnose all sorts of problems, fix software fast and hardware depending on what's broken and how fast I can replace it. I'll also help you with upgrades (figuring out what can be done, as well as doing it), getting data from a dead computer, or changing operating systems.</div>
  <div class="Box"><b>Looking for a tutor?</b><hr> I can teach just about any STEM topic (at least with some time in advance to reassimilate or structure a kind of lesson) and have taught many of them! I'm fine tutoring in a group or individually.<ul>
  <li><b>Math</b>: Math is one of the things I do and teach best. I've probably done the best in Brockville for a few math contests in my day, I've lectured teachers and students on everything from trigonometry to calculus and complex analysis in high school, and I've tutored various students towards a good mindset for success in their mathematical endeavours.</li>
  <li><b>Computer Science or Electronics</b>: I've been in team programming contests in high school, worked as a game programmer, but these days I spend a lot of time thinking abstractly about everything to do with systems. Most of what I have is language and platform agnostic wisdom about software design, but I can also teach you how to use various languages and platforms:<ul>
    <li><b>Languages</b>: I write C++ almost every day, I've written many small games in python as my first language, a fair deal of JavaScript, I've even designed my own language (using C++)! I'll show you how to go about learning any language, and when or why you should learn a language (either generally or for some language). Here's where I just list off languages that I know something about: C, C++, JavaScript, Python, Lua, PHP/SQL, Scheme-like languages, system scripting languages like bash or command prompt, a little Java,... I could probably go on.</li>
    <li><b>Platforms</b>: I can talk about building things that run on windows, linux, different processor architectures, on different kinds of machines with different kinds of peripherals like typical computers, microcontrollers (MCUs), or FPGAs. I could talk about digital or analog communication protocols, and how to use the common ones in programmable electronics systems. </li>
  </ul></li>
  <li><b>Physics, Chemistry, Biology</b>: I've tutored physics and chemistry, and I might have a bit of wisdom about biology. These are all probably things where you might want to give me a chance to review depending on the particular topic. If you're interested about learning a bit beyond high school physics, I can talk a bunch about the kind of physics that's been useful as a programmer (with digital signal processing or electronic circuits for instance) </li>
  </ul></div>
<div class="Box"><b>Looking for our software or its documentation?</b><hr>
I'll provide a bunch of stuff here, access to headers, scripts, for open-source stuff you can build or compile things yourself, then maybe I'll take the liberty of compiling executables that folks can download and run. I may write documentations for our code or I might just try and make it easy to understand the headers we provide, maybe I'll start writing documentation pages when a few people complain about reading headers, we'll see.
